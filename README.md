# British Airways Tableau Visualizations

Welcome to my repository of Tableau projects focusing on British Airways. Here, you will find interactive dashboards and visualizations crafted to analyze and illustrate data patterns, customer reviews, and flight performance.

## About the Data

This repository includes several datasets:
- `British Airways.twbx`: A Tableau workbook with predefined visualizations and dashboards.
- `ba_reviews.csv`: Customer reviews dataset for various flights and services offered by British Airways.
- `Countries.csv`: A dataset containing country-specific information used in conjunction with British Airways' data.

## Projects

Each Tableau project within this repository aims to provide insights into different aspects of the airline's operations, from customer satisfaction to flight metrics. The `.twbx` files are ready-to-view interactive dashboards designed using Tableau.

## Getting Started

To get started, you can clone the repository and explore the datasets and Tableau workbooks. Tableau Desktop or Tableau Public is required to open `.twbx` files.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CharanPonnathota/british-airways-tableau.git
